### Collaborators

This project was done in collaboration with the Liana Tutt (<https://github.com/tuttlr>) for CSSE280: Intro to Web Development at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.

## Project Description
This website allows for users to get recipes from countries around the world at the click of a button and save them to a personal cookbook. The website was built from scratch, with selection of themes, colors, and icons guided by the professor of the course after proposing the concept of the 'Recipe Roulette' to them.
