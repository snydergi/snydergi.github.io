## New Posts
Over the winter quarter, I have been working on some exciting projects including an autonomous salt-spreading robot and EKF SLAM from scratch. These projects are currently in development, but will completed on my portfolio soon! 

I will also be posting about Machine Learning and some personal coding projects. 

Keep posted to learn more about these posts and other cool projects!

For now... here is a little teaser of the salt spreading project:
