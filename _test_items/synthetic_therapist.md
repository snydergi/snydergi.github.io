### Collaborators

This project was done under the guidance of [Lorenzo Vianello](https://github.com/LorenzoVianello95), a post-doc in the Neurorehabilitation and Neural Engineering Laboratory, led by [Dr. Jos√© L. Pons](https://www.sralab.org/researchers/jose-l-pons-phd) at the [Shirley Ryan AbilityLab Legs + Walking Lab](https://www.sralab.org/research/abilitylabs/legs-walking-lab).

## Project Objective

This project aimed to improve patient post-stroke walking gait rehabilitation using a lower-limb exoskeleton with implementation of a machine learning model trained on patient-therapist interactions. The 'Synthetic Therapist' would take the place of the human therapist in an exoskeleton dyad rehabilitation system (link or explanation?), providing predictions from the model as inputs to the patient exoskeleton control loop.

## Results

The Synthetic Therapist successfully utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to accurately predict therapist reactions to patient joint inputs. While active, the wearer of the exoskeleton (ExoMotus-X2, Fourier Intelligence) has their gate assisted and corrected based on outputs of the LSTM being fed into the patient exoskeleton control loop. The Synthetic Therapist runs on a ROS1 Noetic node within the workspace. The model receives input from the subject exoskeleton at ~333Hz via subscriptions to ROS topics, then publishes the output of the LSTM on a ROS topic at ~333Hz, maintaining the real-time requirements of the human-exoskeleton interaction. This allows for a smooth adjustment to the wearers gait.

The model predicts therapist interactions for the patient with a high degree of accuracy. Models typically predict with less than 0.1 radian (~5.7 degrees) root mean square error when compared to therapist data from various patients. Most deviation in the model predictions from true data is seen in the lower amplitude peaks of the gait phase, which already often occur from the exoskeleton inertia causing small oscillation rather than it being a part of the true gait. Like any machine learning model, erroneous predictions may occur with a large error. Protections are established within the code to prevent large predictions that may be out of the range of motion from occurring.

The Synthetic Therapist was developed to aid in walking gait rehabilitation, which is a complex procedure that requires input from doctors and therapists to alter and change therapy to best suit the patient. As such, a variety of parameters can be adjusted during the course of rehabilitation. As in the patient-therapist dyad setup with a virtual linkage, the stiffness, perceived as the amount of applied torque to the patient exoskeleton, can be adjusted so that the exoskeleton provides more or less input on the patients steps. A parameter acting as a joint threshold is adjustable to allow for predictions that go beyond a patients more limited range of motion (ROM), if limited beyond normal ROM, to be capped at the specific patients ROM. Additionally, the main model used in the Synthetic Therapist is equipped to adjust the distance into the future that it predicts. The synched patient-therapist data from training often showed the therapists motion lagging behind the patients as they attempted to match the patient gait while also altering it. To improve on this, the Synthetic Therapist future distance parameter allows for the predictions to lead in front of the patients movement, effectively guiding their leg through the next step based on the previous inputs. The model can predict anywhere from the next time step (~3ms) to ~75ms ahead of the patient. While a small time delta, the result is a more focused and guided input to the control loop as the exoskeleton assists the patient.
