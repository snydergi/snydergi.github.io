<h2 id="project-objective">Project Objective</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to create a rolling and jumping autonomous drone (RAJAD) that would blend the abilities of a conventional drone with the 
simplicity of a wheeled robot. This project aims to create a robot with the advantageous
qualities of both a quadrotor and a wheeled robot, with the ability to roll, jump, and hover briefly if necessary to explore its environment. 
Where traditional wheeled robots are limited to the ground plane, this robot is capable of additional actuation to allow for vertical travel. 
Where quadrotors typically are limited in flight time due to power consumption and battery weight capacity, having the robot ground-based allows
for improved battery capacity and active time by reducing propellor output substantially.</p>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
<p>The must-have goal of this project is to be able to move successfully in an ideal environment: a smooth flat floor.
Accomplishing this is the first step toward improving the robot to be able to navigate uneven surfaces and jump.</p>

<p>The core goal of this project is to produce a robot capable of navigating uneven surfaces, with the ability to jump at least one foot vertically.
This allows for climbing stairs or over debris to broaden applicability.</p>

<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>Throughout the development of this project, a key consideration was the overall mass of the robot. Due to their incredibly small form factor as a quadrotor, the standard Crazyflie 2.1+ has a relatively small payload capacity, at a recommended 15 grams. To improve this capacity, I utilized the Crazyflie Thrust Upgrade, which provided stronger DC motors and higher thrust propellers. The final thrust was measured by placing the robot on a scale and putting slightly more mass attached than it was expected to lift then operating the propellers at maximum thrust to collect data on the difference in measured mass before and after, with the difference being the maximum mass the thrust would be able to counteract. The absolute maximum mass is approximately 60 grams based on the experiment.</p>

<p>The final iteration of the custom fabricated parts combined with the quadrotor achieves a sum mass of ~55 grams, making it within the necessary requirement for liftoff. The assembly structure around the Crazyflie consists of a hub and two wheels. The hub is designed to integrate directly into the Crazyflieâ€™s structure. The hub is stabilized by wrapping around the two sets of header pins then connecting across the center. Threaded heat inserts on the left and right of the quadrotor also allow for screws to connect while using O-Rings as flexible spacers through two holes that already exist on the PCB of the Crazyflie. The arms that stick out from the hub then have space for two ball bearings to be inserted on each side via heating the bearing and fusing it into the 3D printing space that is slightly undersized for it. The use of two bearings per shaft helps ensure axial allignment between the two wheels.</p>
