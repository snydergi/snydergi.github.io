<p>As an in-class assistant for Mechatronics, I had the opportunity to refresh my knowledge of mechatronics, having been selected for this position due to excellence in the course when I took it. Due to staffing shortage, I took on multiple sections of work. My role was not only grading daily quizzes, assignments, and lab work, but also assisting students and being essentially a ‘second professor’ of sorts, helping students troubleshoot their circuits and code. I helped answer questions that the students had and gave feedback whenever I could.</p>

<p>For Robotics Engineering, I established multiple blocks of office hours weekly to provide assistance to students throughout each section. I supported them through lab work, answered exam questions, and provided feedback and advice when needed on projects.</p>

<p>At DEKA, I worked on the Path-Planning team for their SENTRY project, an autonomous mobile robot being developed for security and surveillance. My role began with being introduced to the codebase the project was using, and I was tasked with improving one of the controllers necessary for bot functionality and optimal behavior. My work was done in C++ and I went from a complete novice to reasonably adept with C++ and various extensions. Upon completion of my first project, with my remaining time I researched and outlined a new path smoothing algorithm to allow for route optimization while maintaining static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. A proof-of-concept was created in Python and quickly ported to C++. All code was tested extensively on custom simulation software as well as on the physical device.</p>

<p>My time at E+H T+SP introduced me to industrial engineering. My project for the summer was optimizing the layout of the machine shop that featured two large CNC machines, with space for a third needed, among many other cutting, polishing, and processing stations. I was tasked to improve efficiency and throughput of the shop so it could match the pace of the manufacturing floor. I learned the basics of 5S, Six Sigma, and Kanbans, along with conducting time-studies and routing both people and product, to adjust spacing and placement of machines. Additionally, as an independent project, I created a material stock loss minimizer calculator in Java to allow for more efficient use of raw material. Throughout my time in the shop, I also reviewed and updated work instructions for the production floor.</p>

<h3 id="mechanical-engineering-intern-1">Mechanical Engineering Intern</h3>
<p>At Ventures, I conducted work with a major medical device company that does work in orthopedic implants as well as surgical tools. My project consisted of the rapid prototyping and concept development of an automated version of a surgical tool. I extensively worked with SolidWorks, 3D printing, waterjet cutting, and a full machine shop. Throughout the process, I worked with another intern under the guidance of a Senior Mechanical Engineer and met weekly with the client to establish goals and provide updates.</p>
