		<h2 id="academic-interests">Academic Interests</h2>
<p>From a young age, I have been interested in Robotics. It started with Transformers, Star Wars, and Power Rangers, but quickly became an academic pursuit. The field of robotics has always fascinated me with its unique solutions, problems, and range of applicability. I am invested in the potential of robotics to shape the future. My interest is particularly drawn to Biological-Inspired Robotics and Design, Swarm Intelligence and Behavior, and Low-Cost Modular Robot Design. I feel that these areas have potential for major breakthroughs in the capabilities of robotics and I am eager to get involved in the next step of the future.</p>

<h2 id="personal-interests">Personal Interests</h2>
<p>I have always tried to enrich my time outside of academic work with a plethora of activities. While I do not consider myself an athlete by any sense of the word, I enjoy being active with Volleyball, Climbing, and Ping Pong. For relaxation, I am a big foodie, cook, movie-watcher, and game-player whether it be video games, board games, or role-playing games.â€‹ I also love music, wood working, and reading. I am the type that has a ton of little projects always going on for hobby and fun.</p>
