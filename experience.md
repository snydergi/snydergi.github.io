### Terre Haute, Indiana
### ME430 Mechatronic Systems, CSSE/ME435 Robotics Engineering Teaching Assistant
<p>&nbsp;</p>
As a teaching assistant for Mechatronics, in addition to perfoming standard duties such as grading daily quizzes, assignment, and lab work, I was responsible for aiding students with troubleshooting circuits and code. I assisted with debugging and developing Arduinos, PLC, and MATLAB scripts daily across multiple sections that I assisted with. Robotics Engineering had similar baseline duties, however the course content was based around a Raspberry Pi in addition to an Arduino. The course additionally covered usage of MATLAB GUIs and communication protocols such as MQTT with Python/JS. Full course descriptions for each course from the Rose-Hulman course catalog are below:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
#### ME/CSSE 435 - Robotics Engineering
"Interdisciplinary course in robotics focusing on communication, software development, kinematics, robot GUI design, sensing, control, and system integration. Labs in the course cover MATLAB GUI development with GUIDE, Denavit-Hartenberg parameters, Arduino programming, Arduino to Android communication, Android app development, and OpenCV4Android image recognition. Students in the course will program an Android + Arduino, 6-wheeled mobile robot with 5 DOF servo arm to participate in an outdoor GPS robotics challenge. Cross-listed with CSSE 435."

<p>&nbsp;</p>
#### ME430 - Mechatronic Systems
"Applications of microprocessors and microcontrollers and digital electronics to the design and utilizations of embedded control systems in smart systems and products. Topics include Boolean logic and algebra, system hardware and software development, and interfacing for mechanical applications."

### Manchester, New Hampshire
### Control Systems Engineer Intern
<p>&nbsp;</p>
At DEKA, I worked on the Path-Planning team for their SENTRY project, an autonomous mobile robot being developed for security. My role began with being introduced to the codebase the project was using, and I was tasked with improving one of the controllers necessary for robot functionality and optimal behavior. My work was done in C++ which I had no previous experience but ultimately became a competent programmer. Upon completion of my first project, with my remaining time I researched and outlined a new path smoothing algorithm to allow for route optimization while maintaining static and dynamic obstacle avoidance using B-Splines. A proof-of-concept was created in Python and quickly ported to C++. All code was tested extensively on custom simulation software and RViz2 as well as on the physical device in a real-world environment. This internship was my first introduction to robotics in industry and many of the aspects that come with it, including ROS2, C++, RViz2, and GitHub Enterprise.

### Greenwood, Indiana
### Mechanical Engineering Intern
<p>&nbsp;</p>
My time at E+H T+SP introduced me to industrial engineering. My project for the summer was optimizing the layout of the machine shop that featured two large CNC machines, with space for a third needed, among many other cutting, polishing, and processing stations. I was tasked to improve efficiency and throughput of the shop so it could match the pace of the manufacturing floor. I learned the basics of lean principles, 5S, Six Sigma, and Kanbans, along with conducting time-studies and routing both people and product, to adjust spacing and placement of machines. Additionally, as an independent project, I created a material stock loss minimizer calculator in Java to allow for more efficient use of raw material. Throughout my time in the shop, I also reviewed and updated work instructions for the production floor.

### Terre Haute, Indiana
### Mechanical Engineering Intern
<p>&nbsp;</p>
At Ventures, I collaborated with a major orthopedic company to design and automate a surgical tool aimed at reducing operator fatigue. Under the guidance of a Senior Engineer, I gained valuable mentorship in a group setting while also conducting independent work that fostered personal growth and technical learning. My contributions involved extensive use of SolidWorks for modeling, as well as hands-on prototyping through 3D printing, waterjet cutting, and machining. These tools and techniques enabled rapid prototyping and effective concept generation to meet the project's objectives.
