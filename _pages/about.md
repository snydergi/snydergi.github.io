## Academic Interests
My academic interests have always been geared toward robotics due to the fields range of applicability, unique solutions, and challenging problems. I am fascinated with cutting edge technology and want to contribute to the development of novel solutions to unsolved problems. I hope to build on intersectionality between sustainability and robotics in an effort to preserve humanity. Robots have potential for major breakthroughs in capability and I am eager to get involved in the next step of the future.

### Research interests
* Bio-Inspired Robotics
* Swarm/Multi-Agent Systems
* Modular Robot Design
* Low-Cost, Scalable Robots

## Personal Interests
I try to enrich my time outside of academic work with a plethora of activities. While I do not consider myself an athlete, I do enjoy being active with Volleyball, Climbing, and Ping Pong. For relaxation, I am a big foodie, cook, movie-watcher, and game-player whether it be video games, board games, or role-playing games.â€‹ I also love music, wood working, and reading. I am the type that has a ton of little projects always going on for hobby and fun.
